# Ball stabilization mechanism
## Concept
A simple mechanism that controls the angle of a plate (balance zone) to keep a ball from falling off. The plate should rotate along the two rotational axes perpendicular to the plateâ€™s normal angle proportional to the position of the ball within the balance zone.

## Project Requirements
The mechanism must:
- Be strong enough to support itself and the static weight of the ball. It should also withstand the rotational quaternion and spacial inertial force of dynamic (moving) mechanism structures and the ball.
- maintain a reasonable accuracy, changing the direction and velocity of the ball reliably.
- Be designed with cost and quality of materials in mind. The mechanism should be designed with minimum waste and as low a budget as possible.
